# Introducing SwiftUI

## SwiftUI Essentials

- Learn how to use SwiftUI to compose rich views out of simple ones, set up data flow, and build the navigation while watching it unfold in Xcode's preview.

### Creating and Combining Views

#### Create a New Project and Explore the Canvas

1. Open Xcode and either click "Create a new Xcode project" in Xcode's startup window, or choose File > New > Project.
2. In the template selector, select iOS as the platform, select the App template, and then click Next.
3. Enter "Landmarks" as the product name, select "SwiftUI" for the interface and "Swift" for the language, and click Next. Choose a location to save the project on your Mac.
4. In the Project navigator, select LandmarksApp.swift.
   1. An app that uses the SwiftUI app life cycle has a structure that conforms to the App protocol.
   2. The Structure's body property returns one or more scenes, which in turn provide content for display.
   3. The @main attribute identifies the app's entry point.
5. In the Project navigator, select ContentView.swift.
   1. By default, SwiftUI view files declare two structures.
   2. The first structure conforms to the View protocol and describes the view's content and layout.
   3. The second structure declares a preview for that view.
6. In the canvas, click Resume to display the preview.
   1. If the canvas isn't visible, select Editor > Canvas to show it.
7. Inside the body property, change "Hello, World!" to a greeting for yourself.
   1. As you change the code in a view's body property, the preview updates to reflect your changes.

#### Customize the Text View

1. Customize the text view using the inspector.
   1. In the preview, Command-click the greeting to bring up the structured editing popover, and choose "Show SwiftUI Inspector".
      1. The popover shows different attributes that you can customize, depending on the type of view you inspect.
      2. If it's not clickable, active Selectable on the left bottom
      - <img src="./images/editing_popover.png" alt="Editing Popover" width="200"/>
   2. Use the inspector to change the text to "Turtle Rock", the name of the first landmark you'll show in your app.
   3. Change the Font modifier to "Title".
      1. This applies the system font to the text so that it responds correctly to the user's preferred font sizes and settings.

2. To customize a SwiftUI view, you call methods called modifiers. Modifiers wrap a view to change its display or other properties. Each modifier returns a new view, so it's common to chain multiple modifiers, stacked vertically.
   1. Edit the code by hand to change the padding() modifier to the foreground Color(.green) modifier; this changes the text's color to green.
   - `Text("Turtle Rock").font(.title).foregroundColor(Color.green)`
3. Your code is always the source of truth for the view. When you use the inspector to change or remove a modifier, Xcode updates your code immediately to match.
   1. Open the inspector by Command-clicking on the Text declaration in the code editor, and then choose "Show SwiftUI Inspector" from the popover. Click the color pop-up menu and choose Inherited to change the text color to black again.
   2. Notice taht Xcode updates your code automatically to reflect the change, removing the forgroundColor(.green) modifier.
